# Structural Patterns

* We use structural patterns to eastablish relation between software components in particular settings.
* The goal is to satisfy functional and nonfunctional requirements.
* Functional requirements refer to what the software does.
* NonFunctional requiremnets refer to how well it does its job (like how fast or slow).
* Structual patterns take advantage of inheritance.

### Decorator
Decorator pattern allows adding new features to an object without changing their structures.
* Here the problem is to add new features to the object without subclassing.
* In python we can additional features to a function using the inbuilt decorator
