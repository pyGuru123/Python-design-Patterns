# Creational Pattern

* We use creational design patterns to build objects systematically.
* The main benefit of creational patterns is their flexibility.
* For example differnt types of objects from the same class can be created at runtime using creational patterns.
* In creational pattern, Polymorphism is often in use.

***

### Factory
Factory encapsulates object creation. It is an object specializing in creating other objects.
Factory solves the following problem
* When its uncertain what type of objects we are going to use at runtime.
* When the application needs to decide what classes to be used at runtime.

Example of factory : [Factory.py]()
