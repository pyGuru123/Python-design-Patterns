# Creational Pattern

* We use creational design patterns to build objects systematically.
* The main benefit of creational patterns is their flexibility.
* For example differnt types of objects from the same class can be created at runtime using creational patterns.
* In creational pattern, Polymorphism is often in use.

### Factory
Factory encapsulates object creation. It is an object specializing in creating other objects.
Factory solves the following problem
* When its uncertain what type of objects we are going to use at runtime.
* When the application needs to decide what classes to be used at runtime.

Example of factory : [Factory.py](https://github.com/pyGuru123/Python-design-Patterns/blob/main/Creational%20Pattern/factory.py)

### Abstract Factory
* Abstract factory builds on the factory pattern.
Abstract factory is useful when the user expects to receive a family of multiple related objects but doesn't have to know what fammily it is until runtime.
* A factory returns a single object whereas a abstract factory return two or multiple related objects, like dog and dog food in our example
* Abstract factory creates objects while concrete factories are often singletons.

Example of abstract factory : [abstractFactory.py](https://github.com/pyGuru123/Python-design-Patterns/blob/main/Creational%20Pattern/abstractFactory.py)

### Singleton
Singleton is used when you want to allow only one object to be created from a class. Its an object oriented way of providing global variables.
* In python community, a borg is a term which allows creation of multiple instances but they all share same state, unlike singleton.
* Lets say there's a need of keeping cache of information shared by multiple objects, it can be done either keeping the information in a singleton or sharing it under borg object.

Example of Singleton & Borg : [singleton.py](https://github.com/pyGuru123/Python-design-Patterns/blob/main/Creational%20Pattern/singleton.py)

### Builder
A builder is a solution to an antipattern called as telescoping constructor. An antipattern is the opposite of best practice that we want to avoid. It occuers when a dev tries to create a complex object using a excessive number of constructors.
* The Builder design pattern tries to solve this problem by dividing the process in 4 roles ( divide & conquer strategy )
* Director : incharge of actually building the product
* Abstract Builder : provides all the necessary interfaces required to build the product
* Concrete Builder : inherits from abstract builder and implements the details of the interface
* Product : represents the object being built.
Builder pattern does not rely on polymorphism unlike factory and abstract factory.

Example of Builder : [builder.py](https://github.com/pyGuru123/Python-design-Patterns/blob/main/Creational%20Pattern/builder.py)
