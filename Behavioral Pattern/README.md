# Behavioral Patterns

* It refers to how you make your objects interact with each other.
* The focus here is to defining protocols between these objects when working together to achieve a common goal.
* Beahavorial patterns mostly use methods and their signatures.

### Observer
The observer pattern establishes a one-to-many relationship between a subject and multiple observers.
* The problem here is that a subjec need to be monitored i.e, a observer should be notified when there is change in the subject.
* The scenerio here is to keep track of temeprature of a reactor at a powerplant. registerd observers must be notified when there is a change in the temperature
* The solution uses a abstract class called subject which has an interface that allows operations such as attach, detach and notify. We also need concrete subject classes inheriting from abstract subject class.
